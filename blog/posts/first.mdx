Wanna be free of this heart, yeah
Wanna feel your arms around me
I need you more, need you here
More than I would like to admit
Let's forget about tomorrow, yeah
Should I hide my way forever?
Should I close my eyes and let her get
Hold you tight, call you mine
Think about you every time
I remember that it's over, yeah
You never break, you never lie
You're never ever scared of the dark
So why am I the one who cries
I'm so afraid to be left behind
I think about you a lot
It's almost like I can't stop
Can't stop, yeah, yeah
You never lose, in all you make
So I've been trying hard to pretend
That I'm okay, it's just a phase
And everything is going just great
I think about you a lot
It's almost like I can't stop
Can't stop, yeah-yeah
